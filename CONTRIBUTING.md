# Contributing to Sword Combat Plugin

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** (OpenJDK recommended)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended) or any Java IDE
- **Git** for version control

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mere-Solace/Sword-Combat-Plugin.git
   cd Sword-Combat-Plugin
   ```

2. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run test server**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew runServer
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable production code
- `dev` - Active development branch
- Feature branches - Named descriptively (e.g., `feature/combat-system`, `fix/entity-tracking`)

### Before You Commit

1. **Build successfully**: `./gradlew build`
2. **Format code**: Follow Microsoft Java code standards
3. **Add Javadoc**: Document all public APIs
4. **Test your changes**: Verify in a test server

## Code Standards

### Java Code Style

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/Variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Packages: `lowercase`

### Documentation

- Follow [Microsoft Java Documentation Standards](docs/standards/documentation-standards.md)
- All public classes and methods require Javadoc
- Explain **why**, not **what** in comments

### Example

```java
/**
 * Manages sword combat mechanics for players.
 *
 * <p>This class handles attack actions, damage calculations, and combo tracking
 * for the custom sword combat system.</p>
 *
 * @author Your Name
 * @since 1.0
 */
public class SwordCombatManager {

    /**
     * Executes a sword attack from the player.
     *
     * @param player the player performing the attack
     * @param target the entity being attacked
     * @return true if the attack was successful, false otherwise
     */
    public boolean executeAttack(Player player, Entity target) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Commit Messages

```bash
Add: New feature description
Fix: Bug description
Update: Enhancement description
Refactor: Code improvement description
Docs: Documentation changes
```

## Pull Requests

1. **Create a feature branch** from `dev`
2. **Make your changes** following code standards
3. **Write descriptive PR title** and description
4. **Reference issues** if applicable (e.g., "Fixes #123")
5. **Request review** from project maintainers

### PR Template
