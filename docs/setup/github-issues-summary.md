## Recommended Workflow

### For Owner (Mere Solace)

**Focus on core features first!** These issues can wait:

1. Review #19, #20, #21 when convenient (low priority)
2. Optionally tackle simple issues (#22, #23) for PR practice
3. Weigh in on #24 (unused fields - are these planned features?)

### For DevOps (Chris R. / iAmGiG)

**Build the infrastructure:**

1. **Start**: Generate Javadoc baseline (#26) - non-intrusive, informative
2. **Next**: Prepare Checkstyle config (#29) - draft for review
3. **Then**: Create CI pipeline (#27) - after #20 approved
4. **Meanwhile**: Document and improve existing code

### For Both (Code Review Practice)

Use simple issues for learning:

- #22 (unused imports) - Practice PR workflow
- #23 (unused variables) - Learn code review process
- #25 (Javadoc) - Collaborative documentation

## Next Actions

### Immediate

1. ‚úÖ Issues created and labeled
2. ‚è≥ Waiting for owner to add issues to "Sword Combat Evolve" project
3. ‚è≥ Owner review of issues #19-21

### Short Term

1. Generate Javadoc coverage baseline (#26)
2. Draft Checkstyle configuration (#29)
3. Fix unused imports (#22) - good PR practice

### Medium Term

1. Implement CI pipeline (#27)
2. Begin Javadoc improvements (#25)
3. Investigate unused fields (#24)

### Long Term

1. Establish testing framework (#30)
2. Complete documentation coverage
3. Full automation suite

‚úÖ **Educational** - Each issue is a learning opportunity
‚úÖ **Collaborative** - Built for code review practice
‚úÖ **Incremental** - Bite-sized, manageable tasks
‚úÖ **Documented** - Rationale and context preserved
